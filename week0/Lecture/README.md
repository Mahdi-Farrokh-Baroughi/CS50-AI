# Tip!

> ***If you want to use Breadth-first search algorithm instead of Depth-First Search algorithm, you just need to change "StackFrontier" to "QueueFrontier" in line 89
> also if you want to use greedy best-first search algorithm instead of Depth-First Search algorithm, you need not only replace "Greedy_bestFirstSearch_frontier" with "StackFrontier" but also add self.goal as a parameter to remove function in line 103.***
